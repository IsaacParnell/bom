Welcome to showhost!

This was a small project that turned into something really big and convoluted over time.
It basically runs a game show that includes rounds, scoring, screen display, score display, and hotseat rounds.

I made this in a period where I had just started using jQuery.
Yes I could have made the interface using React but at the time I wasn't too confident
with it and how it worked so I wanted to use a method that I knew how to use and knew worked.

There are a million problems with this but it works sooooo yeah.
If I wrote it again there would be so many changes it wouldn't look the same but hey that's how learning works.
